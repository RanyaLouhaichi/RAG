# Model Manager

The `ModelManager` is a dynamic and adaptive component responsible for selecting the best language model for a given task. Unlike a static mapping, this manager uses a reinforcement learning-based approach to continuously learn and adapt its model selection strategy based on performance.

## Key Responsibilities:

- **Dynamic Model Selection:** Instead of fixed rules, it uses a scoring system to select the best model for an agent and prompt, considering historical performance, recent usage, and context.
- **Performance-Based Learning:** It tracks the performance of each model (success rate, response time, quality) for each agent and updates its selection strategy over time.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** It uses an exploration rate to occasionally try different models, allowing it to discover new, more effective model-agent pairings.
- **Contextual Scoring:** It analyzes the prompt to extract features and uses this context to refine its model selection.
- **Workflow Tracking:** It can track model usage within a specific workflow, providing a detailed summary of which models were used by which agents.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** If a selected model fails, it intelligently chooses the best fallback model based on historical performance.
- **Performance Persistence:** It saves and loads agent performance data from Redis, allowing it to learn across sessions.

## Methods:

- `__init__(...)`: Initializes the manager, auto-detects available models, and loads historical performance data from Redis.
- `generate_response(...)`: The main entry point for generating a response. It handles model selection, execution, performance tracking, and learning.
- `_select_model_for_agent(...)`: The core of the dynamic selection logic. It scores each available model and chooses the best one.
- `_update_agent_performance(...)`: Updates the performance metrics for an agent-model pair after a request.
- `_assess_quality(...)`: A simple function to assess the quality of a generated response.
- `get_agent_performance_stats()`: Provides detailed performance statistics for each agent and model.
- `start_workflow_tracking(...)` and `track_workflow_usage(...)`: Methods for tracking model usage within a specific workflow.

## Usage:

The `ModelManager` is a central component of the orchestrator, providing a sophisticated and adaptive way to manage language models. Its ability to learn and optimize its own behavior makes the entire system more robust, efficient, and effective.
