# Cognitive Model Manager

The `CognitiveModelManager` is a sophisticated component responsible for managing and selecting specialized language models for different types of reasoning tasks. It aims to improve the quality and efficiency of responses by routing prompts to the most suitable model.

## Key Responsibilities:

- **Model Specialization:** Maps different reasoning types (e.g., conversational, strategic, creative) to specific language models that excel at those tasks.
- **Reasoning Type Detection:** Automatically detects the required reasoning type from a prompt and its context.
- **Semantic Caching:** Implements a caching layer (both standard and semantic) using Redis to store and retrieve responses for similar prompts, reducing latency and API calls.
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitors the performance of each model (response time, success rate) and logs this data to Redis for future analysis and optimization.
- **Fallback Mechanism:** Provides a fallback model to ensure that a response is generated even if the specialized model fails.
- **Prompt Enhancement:** Enhances prompts with reasoning-specific instructions to guide the language models toward better performance.

## Reasoning Types

The manager defines the following `ReasoningType` enums:

- `CONVERSATIONAL`
- `TEMPORAL_ANALYSIS`
- `STRATEGIC_REASONING`
- `CREATIVE_WRITING`
- `LOGICAL_REASONING`
- `DATA_ANALYSIS`

## Methods:

- `__init__(self, redis_client: Optional[redis.Redis] = None)`: Initializes the manager with a Redis client and the model specialization mapping.
- `_detect_reasoning_type(...)`: Detects the reasoning type based on the prompt and context.
- `generate_response(...)`: The main method for generating a response. It handles reasoning detection, model selection, caching, and performance tracking.
- `_enhance_prompt_for_reasoning(...)`: Adds specific instructions to the prompt based on the detected reasoning type.
- `get_model_performance_stats(...)`: Retrieves performance statistics for the models from Redis.
- `clear_cache(...)`: Clears the model response cache in Redis.

## Usage:

The `CognitiveModelManager` is used by the orchestrator and other components to generate intelligent and context-aware responses. By dynamically selecting the best model for the job, it enhances the overall cognitive capabilities of the multi-agent system.
