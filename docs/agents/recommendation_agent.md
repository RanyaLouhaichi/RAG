# Recommendation Agent Documentation

## Overview

The `RecommendationAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for providing intelligent and context-aware recommendations. It can analyze the user's query and the available context to generate relevant and actionable recommendations. The agent is also designed to collaborate with other agents, which allows it to provide more comprehensive and context-aware recommendations.

## `RecommendationAgent` Class

### Objective

To provide intelligent, context-aware recommendations by collaborating with other agents to gather comprehensive insights.

### Capabilities

- `PROVIDE_RECOMMENDATIONS`: Can provide recommendations based on its analysis.
- `COORDINATE_AGENTS`: Can coordinate with other agents to fulfill a user's request.
- `RETRIEVE_DATA`: Can retrieve data from various sources.

### Cognitive Cycle

The `RecommendationAgent` follows the same cognitive cycle as the `BaseAgent`:

- **`_perceive(input_data)`**: In this phase, the agent processes the input data, which includes the user's prompt, conversation history, articles, tickets, and predictions. It then updates its beliefs about the task at hand.

- **`_act()`**: This is the main phase of the agent's operation. It orchestrates the recommendation generation process by calling the `_generate_recommendations` method to get the recommendations and then returns them.

- **`_rethink(action_result)`**: In this phase, the agent reflects on the outcome of the recommendation generation process and updates its mental state and competency model.

### Key Methods

- **`_assess_collaboration_needs()`**: This method assesses the need for collaboration with other agents based on the user's query and the available context. For example, if the agent needs more data to make a good recommendation, it may request collaboration with the `JiraDataAgent`.

- **`_generate_recommendations()`**: This is the core method of the agent. It uses a language model to generate recommendations based on the user's prompt, conversation history, articles, tickets, and predictions. The prompt is carefully constructed to provide the language model with all the necessary context to generate high-quality recommendations.

## Usage

The `RecommendationAgent` is used to provide proactive and helpful suggestions to the user. It can be triggered to generate recommendations based on the current context, which can then be presented to the user or used by other agents.
