## Overview

The `ChatAgent` is responsible for managing conversations with the user. It acts as a coordinator, handling user queries and collaborating with other specialized agents to provide intelligent and context-aware responses. The `ChatAgent` is designed to be the primary point of contact for the user.

## `ChatAgent` Class

### Objective

To coordinate conversations, maintain context, and deliver intelligent responses by collaborating with specialized agents when needed.

### Capabilities

- `GENERATE_RESPONSE`: Can generate a response to a user's query.
- `MAINTAIN_CONVERSATION`: Can maintain the context of a conversation over multiple turns.
- `COORDINATE_AGENTS`: Can coordinate with other agents to fulfill a user's request.

### Cognitive Cycle

The `ChatAgent` follows the same cognitive cycle as the `BaseAgent`:

- **`_perceive(input_data)`**: In this phase, the `ChatAgent` processes the user's input, including the prompt, conversation history, and any context from other agents. It then assesses the need for collaboration with other agents based on the user's query and the available context. For example, if the user asks a question about a Jira ticket, the `ChatAgent` may decide to collaborate with the `JiraDataAgent`.

- **`_act()`**: In this phase, the `ChatAgent` generates a response to the user. If collaboration is needed, it will first interact with the appropriate agents to gather the necessary information. It then uses a `ModelManager` to dynamically select the best model for generating the final response. The response is then saved to the shared memory.

- **`_rethink(action_result)`**: In this phase, the `ChatAgent` reflects on the generated response and the overall interaction. It updates its mental state and competency model based on the outcome of the action. This allows the agent to learn and improve over time.

### `run(input_data)`

The main method to execute the agent's cognitive cycle. It takes the input data, processes it through the perceive-act-rethink cycle, and returns the result.

## Collaboration

The `ChatAgent` is designed to collaborate with other specialized agents to handle a wide range of queries. For example:

- It can collaborate with the `JiraDataAgent` to retrieve information about Jira tickets and projects.
- It can collaborate with the `RecommendationAgent` to get recommendations for the user.

This collaborative approach allows the system to provide more accurate and context-aware responses than a single agent could on its own.
