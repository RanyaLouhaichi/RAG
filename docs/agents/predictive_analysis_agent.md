# Predictive Analysis Agent Documentation

## Overview

The `PredictiveAnalysisAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for predicting project outcomes, identifying risks, and providing forecasts. It uses a combination of statistical methods and AI to generate its predictions, which makes them more accurate and reliable. The agent can also provide actionable recommendations to help teams mitigate risks and improve their performance.

## `PredictiveAnalysisAgent` Class

### Objective

To predict project outcomes, identify risks early, and provide actionable forecasts through collaborative intelligence.

### Capabilities

- `RETRIEVE_DATA`: Can retrieve data from various sources.
- `RANK_CONTENT`: Can rank the retrieved content based on its relevance to the query.
- `COORDINATE_AGENTS`: Can coordinate with other agents to fulfill a user's request.
- `PROVIDE_RECOMMENDATIONS`: Can provide recommendations based on its analysis.

### Cognitive Cycle

The `PredictiveAnalysisAgent` follows the same cognitive cycle as the `BaseAgent`:

- **`_perceive(input_data)`**: In this phase, the agent processes the input data, which includes the tickets, metrics, and historical data for a project. It then updates its beliefs about the task at hand.

- **`_act()`**: This is the main phase of the agent's operation. It orchestrates the entire predictive analysis process, which includes:
    1. **Calculating sprint completion probability**: The agent calculates the probability of sprint completion based on the current status of tickets, historical data, and AI-analyzed patterns.
    2. **Forecasting velocity trends**: The agent forecasts the team's velocity for the next few weeks based on historical data.
    3. **Identifying future risks**: The agent identifies potential future risks, such as sprint failure, process bottlenecks, and team burnout.
    4. **Predicting ticket completion**: The agent predicts the completion date for individual tickets.
    5. **Generating early warnings**: The agent generates early warnings for critical issues that require immediate attention.
    6. **Assessing team load**: The agent analyzes the workload of each team member to identify potential burnout risks.

- **`_rethink(action_result)`**: In this phase, the agent reflects on the outcome of the predictive analysis process and updates its mental state and competency model.

### Key Methods

- **`_calculate_sprint_completion_probability()`**: This is a core method that calculates the probability of sprint completion.

- **`_forecast_velocity_trends()`**: This method forecasts the team's velocity for the next few weeks.

- **`_identify_future_risks()`**: This method identifies potential future risks.

- **`_predict_ticket_completion()`**: This method predicts the completion date for individual tickets.

- **`_generate_early_warnings()`**: This method generates early warnings for critical issues.

- **`_assess_team_load()`**: This method analyzes the workload of each team member.

## Usage

The `PredictiveAnalysisAgent` is used to provide insights into the future of a project. It can be triggered to generate a comprehensive set of predictions, which can then be used by other agents or presented to the user.
