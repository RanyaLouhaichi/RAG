# Productivity Dashboard Agent Documentation

## Overview

The `ProductivityDashboardAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for generating productivity analytics and visualizations. It can analyze Jira data, generate insightful metrics and visualizations, and provide actionable recommendations to help teams improve their productivity. The agent is also designed to collaborate with other agents, which allows it to provide more comprehensive and context-aware analysis.

## `ProductivityDashboardAgent` Class

### Objective

To generate intelligent productivity analytics through collaborative data analysis and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

### Capabilities

- `RETRIEVE_DATA`: Can retrieve data from various sources.
- `RANK_CONTENT`: Can rank the retrieved content based on its relevance to the query.
- `COORDINATE_AGENTS`: Can coordinate with other agents to fulfill a user's request.
- `PROVIDE_RECOMMENDATIONS`: Can provide recommendations based on its analysis.

### Cognitive Cycle

The `ProductivityDashboardAgent` follows the same cognitive cycle as the `BaseAgent`:

- **`_perceive(input_data)`**: In this phase, the agent processes the input data, which includes the tickets, recommendations, project ID, and predictions. It then updates its beliefs about the task at hand.

- **`_act()`**: This is the main phase of the agent's operation. It orchestrates the entire analysis and visualization process, which includes:
    1. **Analyzing ticket data**: The agent analyzes the ticket data to calculate key metrics such as cycle time, throughput, and workload distribution.
    2. **Creating visualization data**: The agent creates data for charts and tables to be displayed on the dashboard.
    3. **Generating a report**: The agent generates a textual report that summarizes the productivity analysis.
    4. **Getting collaborative recommendations**: The agent generates recommendations based on the analysis, potentially in collaboration with other agents.

- **`_rethink(action_result)`**: In this phase, the agent reflects on the outcome of the analysis and visualization process and updates its mental state and competency model.
