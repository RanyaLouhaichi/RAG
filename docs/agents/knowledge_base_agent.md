# Knowledge Base Agent Documentation

## Overview

The `KnowledgeBaseAgent` is a specialized agent responsible for evaluating and providing feedback on generated articles. It plays an important role in the quality control of the generated articles, helping to ensure that they are accurate, relevant, and valuable for the users.

## `KnowledgeBaseAgent` Class

### Objective

To evaluate and provide feedback on generated articles, ensuring quality and relevance for Confluence publishing.

### Capabilities

- `EVALUATE_ARTICLE`: Can evaluate a generated article and provide feedback.

### Cognitive Cycle

The `KnowledgeBaseAgent` follows the same cognitive cycle as the `BaseAgent`:

- **`_perceive(input_data)`**: In this phase, the agent processes the input data, which includes the article to be evaluated. It then updates its beliefs about the task at hand.

- **`_act()`**: This is the main phase of the agent's operation. It orchestrates the evaluation process by calling the `_evaluate_article` method to get the evaluation and then returns the results.

- **`_rethink(action_result)`**: In this phase, the agent reflects on the outcome of the evaluation process and updates its mental state and competency model.

### Key Methods

- **`_evaluate_article()`**: This is the core method of the agent. It takes an article as input and uses a language model to evaluate it based on two criteria:
    1. Whether the content is redundant or lacking technical value.
    2. What specific improvements would make the article more valuable.

    It then returns a JSON object with the evaluation results, including a boolean `redundant` flag and a `refinement_suggestion` string.

## Usage

The `KnowledgeBaseAgent` is used to ensure the quality of the articles generated by the `JiraArticleGeneratorAgent`. It can be triggered to evaluate an article and provide feedback, which can then be used to refine the article before it is published to Confluence.
